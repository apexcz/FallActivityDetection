# FallActivityDetection
Uses classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to detect fall activities with data gotten from wearables. Each folder contains the full implementation of the algorithm. The sphere.WEAR.json file contains the raw data collected from the accelerometers.
